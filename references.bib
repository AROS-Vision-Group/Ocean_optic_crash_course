abstract = {A one-parameter two-term Henyey-Greenstein (TTHG) phase function of light scattering in seawater is proposed. The original three-parameter TTHG phase function was reduced to the one-parameter TTHG phase function by use of experimentally derived regression dependencies between integral parameters of the marine phase functions. An approach to calculate a diffuse attenuation coefficient in the depth of seawater is presented.},
